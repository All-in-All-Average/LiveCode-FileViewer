# LiveCode-FileViewer

This is a tree-based file and folder viewer built in LiveCode.
To use, type a valid Filepath into the field at the top and either click the button or press enter
This should display a tree view of that path.
Highlighting an item should display it's full filepath below the tree

Note: this uses an extended version of the Tree View widget, which will send messages on node folding and unfolding. The extension raw files and built files are under "Extensions"
